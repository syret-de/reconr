## Introduction


Reconr is an automation tool designed to automate pentesting tasks. The core concept revolves around using workflow files, which define a list of tasks that can be applied to multiple targets. This approach simplifies repetitive pentesting processes and enhances efficiency.

## Installation

You will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install). 
I would also suggest to install [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) for processing the output. 
If your installing it on Ubuntu, juste use this [script](install.sh)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reconr.git

# Change directory
cd reconr

# Install dependencies
go build -o reconr cmd/reconr/main.go
```
